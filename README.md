## Network Visualisation for Ingham et al. 2021

ShinyR application to visualisation the results from dynamic Bayesian network analysis applied to a microarray time course after exposing the major malaria vector *Anopheles coluzzii* to a WHO deltamethrin tube assay. [Full analysis instructions found here](https://github.com/FrankD/AnophelesInsecticideExposure).

Download the files in the repository and put them in the same folder, open 'Network_Visualisation2.R' in R studio and select 'Run App'.

Posterior probability used for display can be selected using the slider.

Individual transcripts of interest can be selected using the drop down menu.

Hover mouse over node and the node ID will appear in the select ID drop down menu.

**Coloured nodes represent *a priori* resistance candidates**

Black nodes are transcription factors selected for further analysis in the study.

Blue nodes are cytochrome p450s.

Lighter green nodes are GSTs.

Orange nodes are carboxylesterases.

Darker green nodes are ABC transporters.

Purple are UGTs.
